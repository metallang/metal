# Metal

A prototype compiled programming language, striving to be an easy-to-use, borrow checked, non-garbage-collected,
memory safe, robust programming language.

## Contributing

As an open source project, we welcome contributions! However, because the project is still in it's early days,
the development is rather turbulent. For that reason, we suggest you to first let us know of your intentions by
opening an issue, or [joining our Discord](https://discord.gg/fDCMSbgpsB) and saying "hello" there. Thanks!

## Development

### Rust

The Metal toolchain uses the nightly Rust channel, so to work on it you should use a reasonably recent nightly Rust installation.

#### Adding Dependencies

When adding dependencies to Metal please make sure to only add the main dependency information (i.e. `tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }`)
to the `Cargo.toml` in Metal's root directory. Then, when using the dependency in one of Metal's child crates, in lieu of adding it directly, only add it
as a workspace dependency (i.e. `tokio = { workspace = true }`).
